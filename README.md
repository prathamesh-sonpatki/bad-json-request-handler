# BadJsonRequestHandler

![Gem Version][gem-version-img]

You have a Rails API endpoint which expects JSON request payload. But some clients
send invalid JSON requests.
This typically results in following error.

```
ActionDispatch::Http::Parameters::ParseError: 767: unexpected token at '{ event: { seconds: }}'
```

This results in a 500 error from the server. But client does not get an idea that the
request payload was invalid. What if you can instead respond with 400 Bad Request response
which clearly tells the client that the request is invalid. They may start sending valid
requests going forward!

That's where this gem comes into the picture. It captures the `Parameters::ParseError`
and returns a Bad Request response back. Once you use the initialize from this gem,
the response will be as follows.

```
HTTP 400
{"errors"=>{"message"=>"Invalid request payload: 767: unexpected token at '{ event: { seconds: }}'"}}
```
